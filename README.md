☁️ Integrating AI into Cloud and Security workflows helps enterprises stay prepared for potential threats and gain a competitive edge.

Predictive threat intelligence, real-time anomaly detection and automated incident response redefines traditional security, which is reactive — instead of acting when the damage is done, using Machine Learning tools can neutralise threats before they impact your infrastructure.

In this project, my aim is to design and implement a robust transaction monitoring system on AWS incorporating Machine Learning tools, to deliver real-time fraud detection while emphasising scalability, security, and optimised costs at an enterprise scale.
